# KJSH
Kunal's Java Shell

This program is intended to replace normal Linux shells (like bash) because I find the syntax to be unwieldy and difficult to use.
KJSH is mainly for people in the same position I was in a few years ago.
I wanted to get started with Linux, but bash was a huge learning curve.
I wished there was another way I could interact directly with the operating system in a language and style that was more intuitive.

I chose to bring the idea of "write once, run anywhere" to the terminal by using Java to interact with the OS in a command line-like fashion.

(Please Note: the code is still in alpha, so the compiling system may not work in Windows. My apologies!)

The Next Step(s)

Support for ANSI escape sequences by reading dirrectly from "System.in" instead of a BufferedReader
Support for basic auto-complete (possibly using an external library if neccessary, preferably not)
