Kunal's Java SHell

This program is intended to replace normal Linux shells (like bash) because they are very ugly and the syntax is difficult to use. (in my opinion)
I chose to bring the idea of "write once, run anywhere" to the terminal by using Java to interact with the OS in a command-line like fassion.

(Please Note: the code is still in alpha, the compiling system may not work in Windows. Sorry.)
