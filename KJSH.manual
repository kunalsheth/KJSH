HOW TO USE KJSH:

Arguments:

—-SrcDir [source directory path]



You can control the behavior of the shell by using these annotations between lines of Java code:

@Run
	Instantly compiles and runs all the data stored in the buffers
	Calls a @ClearLines and @ClearClass
	The Imports buffer is not clear and is reused

@Wait
	Useful for writing multiline statements and blocks

@NoWait
	Enabled by Default
	Calls a @Run every time the user hits Enter after typing Java code
	Makes it impossible to write multiline statements or blocks	

@Imports
	Directs the input to the Imports buffer

@Lines
	Enabled by Default
	Directs the input to the Lines buffer

@Class
	Directs the input to the Class buffer

@Imports?
	Prints the data stored in the Imports buffer

@Lines?
	Prints the data stored in the Lines buffer

@Class?
	Prints the data stored in the Class Components buffer

@ClearImports
	Clears the Imports buffer

@ClearLines
	Clears the Lines buffer

@ClearClass
	Clears the Class Components buffer

@NoPersist
	Enabled by Default
	Deletes the source directory after shutdown

@Persist
	Saves source directory after shutdown
	Session can be resumed if —-SrcDir is set the current source directory path

@ResetSrcDir
	Deletes all the files stored in the source directory
	Calls a @ClearImports, @ClearLines, and @ClearClass
	Starts from the root class
	Useful for removing all inherited methods and fields
